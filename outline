 [servlet to JSP form input?]
 webpage for input of users, list with check boxes for admin to pick participants 
 and space to input tournament name.
  
  
 App will build brackets with random seeding (with byes as needed) track rounds and winners. 
 display by current data.  
 Each round is saved when it's completed using winners list to fill in slots on next round of tournament. 
 Last four need a losers bracket to get third place finish. 
 
 
 Build SQL database to hold/store lists of tournaments, participants and winners by round. 
 Keeps usernames and passwords (passwords will be hashed/encrypted) 
 keep a saved copy of old/finished tournaments 
(Full bracket/tabs by rounds, need to figure out display type. may depend on tournament size.)
 
 
 Build webpage to display output brackets with current information.
(full brackets or tabs by round/ not sure which will display better. 
 Maybe limit to 16 per page for larger tournaments?) 
 
 
 Ability to search by tournament, date or user/participant. 
 
 
 Ability to have users sign up via website (Admin still picks eligible users)
